{"name":"FTVisualizer","body":"<VIDEO>\r\n\r\nFTVisualizer is a tool that visualizes family trees. Since a lot of tools out there \r\ndeal with static visualization of family trees (e.g. graphs), this tool focuses \r\non building animated visualization based on dates (birthday dates, wedding dates, \r\ndeath dates,... etc). Using events and dates enables the tool to give a demonstration \r\nof how a family grew over a time period. \r\n\r\nThe back-end (visualizer) was built using OpenGL, C++. The UI was build using AutoIt. For compiling instructions see [here]().\r\n\r\n","tagline":"A family tree animated visualizer.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
